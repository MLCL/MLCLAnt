# MLCLAnt

MLCLAnt is a collection of Ant taskdefs created to help in the build process of Java projects.

## Distribution 

The software available in source-code and binaries. Binaries are available in the *Downloads* section of the project page at GitHub (https://github.com/MLCL/MLCLAnt). 

## Dependencies

The project requires [Java 6](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed on the system. As an extension to existing Ant tasks the project necessarily depends on Apache Ant [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org). The project also depends on JUnit [JUnit 4](http://www.junit.org/), which is required for unit testing the project.

## Building

Compiling the software from a source distribution

### From the command line

To compile the software from the command line:

```sh
$ ant dist
```

This will compile the source code, and create a new directory `/dist/` containing the project `jar` file, and a copy of the various required libraries.
